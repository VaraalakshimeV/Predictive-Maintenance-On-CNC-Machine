## 💡 The Business Problem

At **Maxbyte Technologies**, the maintenance team faced a critical bottleneck: **CNC machine monitoring** was entirely reactive, leading to **unexpected breakdowns and production losses**:

- ❌ Manual vibration analysis was time-consuming and error-prone
- ❌ Reactive maintenance led to unexpected machine breakdowns
- ❌ Inconsistent fault classification across different operators
- ❌ Lack of predictive insights resulted in production downtime
- ❌ No standardized risk assessment for maintenance prioritization

**The Challenge:** Develop an automated system to predict machine failures before they occur and prioritize maintenance activities based on risk analysis.

---

## ✨ My Solution

I designed and built an **end-to-end predictive maintenance system** that automates fault detection and maintenance prioritization—from data collection to RPN calculation and visualization.

### **What It Does:**
**Input:** Real-time vibration data from 4 sensor types on CNC spindle motors  
**Process:** Vibration Monitoring → ISO 10816 Classification → MLP Prediction → FMEA Analysis → Dashboard  
**Output:** Interactive dashboard with fault predictions and maintenance priorities in **real-time**

### **Key Innovation:**
Engineered an intelligent RPN-based ranking system that prioritizes maintenance activities by calculating **Risk Priority Number (Severity × Occurrence × Detection)**—transforming subjective maintenance decisions into data-driven action plans.

## 📊 Business Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Result |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Fault Detection** | Manual inspection | 99.8% automated | **Significantly reduced human error** |

## 📈 RPN (Risk Priority Number) Analysis

### **Formula**

```
RPN = Severity × Occurrence × Detection
```

### **Rating Scales**

#### **Severity** (Based on Fault Type)

| Fault Type | Severity Rating | Impact |
|------------|-----------------|--------|
| 0 - No Failure | 0 | No impact |
| 1 - Low | 3 | Minor performance degradation |
| 2 - Medium | 5 | Reduced efficiency, potential issues |
| 3 - High | 7 | Critical - machine failure imminent |

#### **Occurrence** (Based on Probability)

| Probability | Occurrence Rating | Meaning |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| Highest | 10 | Very frequent |
| Middle | 5 | Occasional |
| Lowest | 1 | Rare |

#### **Detection** (Based on Probability)

| Detectability | Detection Rating | Meaning |
|---------------|------------------|---------|
| Hard to detect | 10 | Late detection |
| Moderate | 5 | Normal detection |
| Easy to detect | 1 | Early warning |

### **RPN Interpretation**

| RPN Range | Priority | Action Required |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| 500-1000 | 🔴 Critical | Immediate maintenance |
| 200-499 | 🟠 High | Schedule within 24 hours |
| 100-199 | 🟡 Medium | Schedule within week |
| 1-99 | 🟢 Low | Monitor and log |
| 0 | ✅ None | Continue operation |
